<h1>âœŒ Hi there. I'm Aditya yadav</h1>
I am a *hobbyist programmer* who like to tinker around with whatever tool i find intersting  
and i want to see how far i can stretch the test the tool.  
I always like to admire the features people work hard to put in a piece of software.  

I also like the open source software in general.

This blog is my attempt to gather whatever i learn about as well as show what technologies  
i like to work with.
It also showcases the tools i use like [doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) which i love to tinker with.
