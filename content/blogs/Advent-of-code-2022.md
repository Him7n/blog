# {{ $frontmatter.title }}
## Why

- I want to get better at writing rust.
- Learn about parser combinator libraries like neo
- Get some practice with Data Structure and Algorithms.

## Cheating
I know in the spirit of question we are supposed to do them on our own.  
But if i get stuck i will be using the [https://fasterthanli.me/series/advent-of-code-2022](fasterthanlime series: Advent of code 2022) as a fallback to look at good practices or solutions.
